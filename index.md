# Siping's Project List

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Siping and I am a master student at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I began to learn C++ programming at 13 yr/o, and still on the way to learn and master it. Meanwhile, I also had fun playing with Rust, Golang, and other programming languages. My interest lies in infrastructure software engineering, especially high-performance computing & heterogeneous computing (GPU, ASIC, distributed systems, etc.).
