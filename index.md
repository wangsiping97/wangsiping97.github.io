# Siping's Project List

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Siping and I am a master student at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My interest lies in infrastructure software engineering, especially high-performance computing & heterogeneous computing (GPU, ASIC, distributed systems, etc.). Before diving into these fields, I had experiences in quant research, and even before that I also interned at securities companies! This may sound crazy as I've been thrown myself into such broad areas, but it was in these trial-and-error experiences that I identified the jobs I enjoyed and the industries I was most excited about âœ¨

I began to learn C++ programming at 13 yr/o, and still on the way to learn and master it. Meanwhile, I also had fun playing with Rust, Golang, and other programming languages. Just enjoy building things at your fingertips!
