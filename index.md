# Siping's Project List

Siping started to learn programming and mathematical Olympiads at the age of 13. After receiving the 1st prize at National High School Mathematical Contest in 2014, she was admitted to Tsinghua University a year later, where she graduated with 200 units in both computer science and finance/business coursework. Siping always enjoys taking challenges and stretching her limits. Graduating by 05/2022 from CMU, she is currently on her way of becoming an excellent software engineer in computer systems, modern computing technologies and related fields.
